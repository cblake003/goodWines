<h1>goodWines</h1>

As a software engineering fellow with General Assembly, our second project was to create a working browser application with complete CRUD capability as well as Oauthentication. I'm a huge fan of wine and learning all about it, so I knew it would be fun to create a wine based app that users could share to give ratings, reviews, and find new wines to try. Wines consist of their brand, year created, type, variety, and alcohol content. Each wine entry can be edited or deleted by the creator of the wine as long as that creator is logged in. Anyone who is logged in can also create their own reviews for that wine and delete their review if they so choose. Logged in users are also able to add new brands for the wine list as well. Anyone on the page can browse wines by brand or by the full wine list.

Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js were used in the creating of this game.

<h1>Site Navigation</h1>

User comes to the home page of goodWines.

User clicks "See Full Wine List" on home page and opens the wine list.

The full wine list will have all wines that have been created on the application.

The user may either click the brand to see all wines associated with that specific brand, or they may click Wine Details to learn more about the wine.

If the user chooses to click the "Brand", then they will be taken to the brand's show page.

The user can then see all of the wines associated with that particular brand. 

The user can also choose to browse the full wine list by click "Full Wine List" in the navigation bar, or going to the Home page and clicking "See Full Wine List".

From the full wine list, the user can then click "Wine Details" to be taken to that specific wine's detail page which will have it's reviews listed and average rating.

A user is only able to delete their own comment, which can be done by clicking the "X" next to their comment.

If a user would like to edit a wine that they have created, then they can click the Edit Wine button to pull up the edit page.

A user can also delete any wine they have added by clicking the "Delete Wine" button at the bottom of the wine details page.

<h1>Next Steps:</h1>

I plan to update this app with several ideas. First, I'll be implementing an API so users can search a full list of wines and brands without having to manually enter each one. Then, I'd like to add a few more styling updates in regards to buttons and fonts. Finally, I'll be adding user profiles with their specific wines and a favorites section for those wines, as well as allowing users to recommend wines based on a recommendation page.
